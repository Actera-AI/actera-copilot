# Contributing

Open a pull request with the problem, the resulting behavior, and the checks you
ran. Keep unrelated changes separate. Run these checks with Node.js 22+ and the
GitHub Copilot CLI:

```sh
npm test
npm run check:plugin
npm run check:release
```

Let CI pass before merging; `ci-result` is the required check. `test/unit`
contains offline tests. CI also installs the plugin from the checkout with the
Copilot CLI on Linux, macOS and Windows, and compares the installed copy with the
source. Never put contributor tests or tooling in the installed payload under
`plugins/actera`.

Use synthetic fixtures. Do not commit credentials, customer data, captured
sessions, local configuration, or build caches. CI scans the Git history for
secrets with Gitleaks, which does not replace review.

## The vendored hook package

The hook bridge, pairing, input capture and bundled scanner come from the
[agent-hooks package](https://github.com/Actera-AI/actera-agent-hooks), vendored
under `plugins/actera/vendor/agent-hooks`. Only the core and the Copilot adapter
are vendored. Change them in that package and release it, then move this plugin to
the release in the pull request that needs it:

```sh
npm run vendor:agent-hooks -- --version <x.y.z>
```

The script downloads the release, verifies its SHA-256, and records the release
and every file's SHA-256 in `scripts/agent-hooks.lock.json`. `npm test` rejects
any vendored file that differs. Do not edit vendored files in place. The package
owns the API contract snapshot, scanner sources and their checks.

To try an unreleased change, `npm run vendor:agent-hooks -- --from ../actera-agent-hooks`
vendors a local checkout. CI refuses a lock from a local pack, so vendor a release
before merging. `npm run check:release` downloads the named release, checks the
vendored files against it, and warns when a newer release exists.

## Local development

The plugin connects to the hosted service defined in
`plugins/actera/vendor/agent-hooks/src/core/defaults.mjs`; users never choose an
endpoint. For local development, set `ACTERA_API_ORIGIN` (HTTPS, or HTTP on
loopback) in the shell that launches Copilot, then run `/actera:connect`. The
override applies only at pairing time and is stored as that connection's
`baseUrl`, so switching services means reconnecting. Set
`ACTERA_COPILOT_BRIDGE_HOME` to keep a test connection apart from your own
`~/.actera/copilot`, and `COPILOT_HOME` to keep a test Copilot apart from your own
`~/.copilot`. Keep the test agent, machine key and bridge state outside the repository.

A local marketplace loads the plugin live from the checkout, so edits apply to the
next Copilot session:

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace add ./
copilot plugin install actera@actera
```

## Changes and releases

Describe user-visible changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and bump the version in
`plugins/actera/.github/plugin/plugin.json` and `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`
in the same pull request. Follow the [installation checks](docs/installation-checks.md)
before merging a version bump. Participation is governed by the
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
